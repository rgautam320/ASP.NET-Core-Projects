# Book List Razor App

This app has CRUD operations using ASP.NET with RazorPages.

It has been implemented with two ways.

### 1. With Controllers (API Calls with Ajax)

Created API to fetch all books and delete book. They are getting called inside JavaScript code with the help of Ajax. Data Table has been used to show data beautifully.

### 2. Without Controllers

All CRUD operations are there. You can Create Book, Update Book and Delete Book. You can view all the books in the home page only.

## Preview

### 1. Home Page

It shows all the Books available in two tables. First table is rendered with table attribute in HTML and Second one is being rendered with Ajax. Ajax is making call to Get All books API, and with the help of Data Table, it is being rendered.
